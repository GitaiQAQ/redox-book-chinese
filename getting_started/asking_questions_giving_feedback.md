Asking questions, giving feedback or anything goes contact
==========================================================

If you have questions, feedback or anything else for us, you should join #redox at the Mozilla IRC network (`irc.mozilla.org`). Originally, we used FreeNode, but switched to Mozilla IRC, due to the Rust channel also being there.

Alternatively you can use [our Forum].
